    "scripture": "And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof. And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark.",

    "content": "Most Christians try to meet God at the Ark by keeping the commandments, by going to this meeting, by doing those things, by not sinning, by living purely. God, however, says He’ll meet us not at the Ark, but at that which covers it - the mercy seat. How do we walk with the Lord practically? Not by anything we do, how long our devotions are, how many chapters of the Bible we’ve read, how many prayers we offer, but simply and solely by the unmerited, undeserved, unearned favor of God. This is where so many people miss it. Although they know they’re saved by grace, they think they’re sanctified through works. Big mistake. A true relationship with God is not about witnessing, ministry, or devotional life. It’s all about what He did in and through Christ. On that first Easter Sunday morning, had you looked into the empty tomb, you would have seen two angels sitting, one at the head and one at the foot of the blood-stained slab where the body of Jesus had lain (John 20:12). Leviticus 16:14 tells us that the mercy seat would be sprinkled with blood. Thus, the mercy seat paints a perfect picture of the only way we can have fellowship with God, that being through the finished work of the Son.",

    "scripture_reference": "Exodus 25:16",
    "content": "The Testimony is the Ten Commandments, the two tables of stone written by the finger of God (Exodus 31:18). “Come boldly before the throne of grace and find mercy and grace to help in time of need,” God says to us (see Hebrews 4:16). “But I can’t,” we say. “I haven’t prayed in days. I haven’t been to church in weeks. I haven’t witnessed in months. I haven’t kept the commandments.” Where were the commandments kept? In the Ark. Who kept the commandments? Jesus. “I do always those things that please [the Father],” He said (John 8:29). Jesus kept the commandments perfectly. And as believers, we are in Him positionally (2 Corinthians 5:17). Therefore, the Father looks at us and doesn’t see our sin. He looks at us and sees His Son (Romans 3:22).",

    "content": "“Draw nigh to Me and I will draw nigh to you,” God says to us (see James 4:8). Yet to this group, God says, “Come and worship ye afar off.” They were told to worship even though they were to worship from afar. I know that because of the work of Christ on the Cross, I can come boldly unto the throne of grace. I can draw nigh to God. I can call Him Abba, or Papa. But the fact is, sometimes I don’t feel that way emotionally. I feel like I’m worshiping Him from afar. Ever feel that way? Take heart. I have learned that it’s okay because God is worthy of worship whether I am emotionally engaged or not. Worship is not about how I feel. It’s all about who God is. And He is worthy to receive glory and honor and power, for He has created all things and for His pleasure they are and were created - whether we feel this or not (Revelation 4:11).",

    "scripture": "I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.",
    "scripture_reference": "Exodus 23:29–30",
    "content": "“I’ve gone to Bible study for six weeks,” some say, “and I’m still depressed, still defeated.” Or, “I’ve been praying for three months, and my situation still hasn’t changed.” The Lord, however, says, “I’ll not drive out your enemies as quickly as you might think because there’s something else in play. If I drove them out in one year, the wild beasts would multiply. Therefore, until you’re increased, until you’re ready to occupy the land, I’m keeping them there in order to keep the fields tilled and the wild beasts at bay.” This is hard for me because patience doesn’t come easy. I like things to happen immediately. But that’s not the way God works. “Count it all joy,” He says, “when you go through trials, in order that patience might have her perfect work” (see James 1:2–4). I want to get ahead of God, but He says, “If the project was completed, if the answer was given on your schedule, you wouldn’t be ready for it. My timing is perfect - any earlier, and it would be disastrous. In the meantime, you’ll be increased by talking the situation over with Me, by waiting on Me, and by spending time with Me.” “I want this kind of ministry,” we say, or “that kind of girl to marry,” or “this type of family.” “Great!” the Lord says. “But I’ve got a lot of work to do to make you the kind of person who can handle that responsibility. It’s not going to happen quickly. Little by little, I’ll drive out the obstacles. In the meantime, stay close to Me.”",

    "scripture": "And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

    "scripture_reference": "Exodus 20:18–19",
    "content": "So powerful was God’s power and potency, His glory and grandeur that the people said, “You speak to us, Moses, because if God speaks to us, we’ll die.” And that’s the way it’s supposed to be. The Word of God is powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces. It divides. It kills our pride, our self-centeredness, and our flesh (Hebrews 4:12). And because it does, the person who wants to pamper his flesh, the person caught up in the sins of the flesh will often be one who doesn’t want to hear from God anymore. If I choose to indulge my flesh day after day, week after week, I won’t be at Bible study six months down the road. If you’re at a place where lately it’s been hard to get into the Word, I have great news for you: God wants to do something special in you. Satan sees what God desires to do and is trying to keep you from that blessing. It’s a big one, a great one. So pick up the Word, let God speak, and discover the blessings in store.",

    "scripture": "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.",
    "scripture_reference": "Exodus 20:17",
    "content": "Of all the commandments, the last one is probably taken the least seriously. If a person breaks the sixth commandment, he might be executed. If he breaks the eighth, he might end up in jail. If he breaks the ninth, he might be sued. But if he breaks the tenth commandment, not only is he forgiven, but applauded, for coveting is a key component of our culture. Essentially, to covet is simply to want more than one possesses. Our economy is based upon this. Society screams at us that the way to have real life is to have this car or that toy. But the Giver of Life, the Author of Life, the One who declared, “I am the Life,” said, “That’s not true. A man’s life does not consist of the stuff he has materially.” And to illustrate His point, He went on to give a parable of a man who had so many material goods that it was necessary for him to construct bigger barns to hold it all. Although the financial planners would consider him wise, and his culture might consider him blessed, God considered him a fool for failing to lay up treasure in the only place that matters: Heaven (Luke 12:20). If God blesses you materially, wonderful! God gives us richly all things to enjoy (1 Timothy 6:17). I find it interesting that in Jesus’ parable, the rich man was planning to enjoy his wealth in the future (Luke 12:19). In other words, up to that point, he never truly enjoyed what he had. And such is all too often the case. The man living for things, wanting more things, focused on things will never, ever be satisfied; he will always think he needs just a few more things to make him happy. The solution? Not only are we to enjoy material blessings, but we are to employ them, not to make more money for ourselves, but to help others, to extend the Gospel to others. Abraham, a wealthy man of Ur, left his comfortable life behind to seek a city whose builder and maker was God (Hebrews 11:10). He saw the big picture. He saw the Kingdom. And so must we.",

    "scripture": "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.",
    "scripture_reference": "Exodus 20:16",
    "content": "The biblical viewpoint of bearing false witness is not confined to the telling of bold-faced lies, but also includes being tricky with the truth. In the one account where the phrase “false witness” is used in Scripture, we see individuals falsely accusing Jesus of threatening to destroy the Temple when, in fact, He was speaking of His own death (Matthew 26:59–61). Because he is the Father of Lies, Satan is the ultimate false witness, accusing us day and night before God’s throne as he points out our failings, our shortcomings, and our sins (Revelation 12:10). Jesus, on the other hand, is the Faithful and True Witness (Revelation 3:14), our Advocate, our defense lawyer. Are you a true witness or a false witness? If the person sitting next to you is a believer, he or she is righteously robed, Heaven-bound, Spirit-filled, positionally pure. Speaking anything less of them is bearing false witness. Oh, you might give the right information, but in so doing, do you convey the wrong implication? You might say lots of nice things about them, but do you add a “but, . . .” a “however, . . .” an “I don’t know if I should share this, but . . .”? If so, you’re a false witness because, although you might be telling the truth, you’re not telling the whole truth. You’re failing to factor in God’s estimation of them. If you’re prone to bearing false witness, consider the following remedies: Say less, for as Solomon so insightfully declared, “In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise” (Proverbs 10:19). Pray more. “Remove from me the way of lying,” David prayed (Psalm 119:29). Think again. Before you say anything about anyone else, THINK: T: Is what you are about to say the whole Truth? H: Is it Helpful? Will people be edified? I: Is it Inspirational? Will God be praised as a result? N: Is it Necessary? K: Is it Kind? The best way to keep from bearing false witness is to simply say less, pray more, and think again.",
