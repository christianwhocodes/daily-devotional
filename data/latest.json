  "scripture": "And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels. And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.",

  "content": "The instruments used to trim the wicks and snuff out the candles were to be pure gold. So too, there will be people in our lives who are there morning and evening, “snipping” and “snuffing.” And, although my tendency is to belittle them, I am in error when I do because they provide golden opportunities for me to burn brighter. I find it interesting that although the weight is given of the Lampstand (a talent), unlike the Ark and the Table of Showbread, the dimensions aren’t given. Could this be because there is no limit to how brightly we are to shine?",
