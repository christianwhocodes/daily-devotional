  "content": "“Draw nigh to Me and I will draw nigh to you,” God says to us (see James 4:8). Yet to this group, God says, “Come and worship ye afar off.” They were told to worship even though they were to worship from afar. I know that because of the work of Christ on the Cross, I can come boldly unto the throne of grace. I can draw nigh to God. I can call Him Abba, or Papa. But the fact is, sometimes I don’t feel that way emotionally. I feel like I’m worshiping Him from afar. Ever feel that way? Take heart. I have learned that it’s okay because God is worthy of worship whether I am emotionally engaged or not. Worship is not about how I feel. It’s all about who God is. And He is worthy to receive glory and honor and power, for He has created all things and for His pleasure they are and were created - whether we feel this or not (Revelation 4:11).",
