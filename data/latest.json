  "scripture": "I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.",

  "content": "“I’ve gone to Bible study for six weeks,” some say, “and I’m still depressed, still defeated.” Or, “I’ve been praying for three months, and my situation still hasn’t changed.” The Lord, however, says, “I’ll not drive out your enemies as quickly as you might think because there’s something else in play. If I drove them out in one year, the wild beasts would multiply. Therefore, until you’re increased, until you’re ready to occupy the land, I’m keeping them there in order to keep the fields tilled and the wild beasts at bay.” This is hard for me because patience doesn’t come easy. I like things to happen immediately. But that’s not the way God works. “Count it all joy,” He says, “when you go through trials, in order that patience might have her perfect work” (see James 1:2–4). I want to get ahead of God, but He says, “If the project was completed, if the answer was given on your schedule, you wouldn’t be ready for it. My timing is perfect - any earlier, and it would be disastrous. In the meantime, you’ll be increased by talking the situation over with Me, by waiting on Me, and by spending time with Me.” “I want this kind of ministry,” we say, or “that kind of girl to marry,” or “this type of family.” “Great!” the Lord says. “But I’ve got a lot of work to do to make you the kind of person who can handle that responsibility. It’s not going to happen quickly. Little by little, I’ll drive out the obstacles. In the meantime, stay close to Me.”",
