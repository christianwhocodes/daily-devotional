  "content": "Of all the commandments, the last one is probably taken the least seriously. If a person breaks the sixth commandment, he might be executed. If he breaks the eighth, he might end up in jail. If he breaks the ninth, he might be sued. But if he breaks the tenth commandment, not only is he forgiven, but applauded, for coveting is a key component of our culture. Essentially, to covet is simply to want more than one possesses. Our economy is based upon this. Society screams at us that the way to have real life is to have this car or that toy. But the Giver of Life, the Author of Life, the One who declared, “I am the Life,” said, “That’s not true. A man’s life does not consist of the stuff he has materially.” And to illustrate His point, He went on to give a parable of a man who had so many material goods that it was necessary for him to construct bigger barns to hold it all. Although the financial planners would consider him wise, and his culture might consider him blessed, God considered him a fool for failing to lay up treasure in the only place that matters: Heaven (Luke 12:20). If God blesses you materially, wonderful! God gives us richly all things to enjoy (1 Timothy 6:17). I find it interesting that in Jesus’ parable, the rich man was planning to enjoy his wealth in the future (Luke 12:19). In other words, up to that point, he never truly enjoyed what he had. And such is all too often the case. The man living for things, wanting more things, focused on things will never, ever be satisfied; he will always think he needs just a few more things to make him happy. The solution? Not only are we to enjoy material blessings, but we are to employ them, not to make more money for ourselves, but to help others, to extend the Gospel to others. Abraham, a wealthy man of Ur, left his comfortable life behind to seek a city whose builder and maker was God (Hebrews 11:10). He saw the big picture. He saw the Kingdom. And so must we.",
