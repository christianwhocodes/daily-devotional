  "scripture": "And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.",
  "scripture_reference": "Exodus 20:18–19",
  "content": "So powerful was God’s power and potency, His glory and grandeur that the people said, “You speak to us, Moses, because if God speaks to us, we’ll die.” And that’s the way it’s supposed to be. The Word of God is powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces. It divides. It kills our pride, our self-centeredness, and our flesh (Hebrews 4:12). And because it does, the person who wants to pamper his flesh, the person caught up in the sins of the flesh will often be one who doesn’t want to hear from God anymore. If I choose to indulge my flesh day after day, week after week, I won’t be at Bible study six months down the road. If you’re at a place where lately it’s been hard to get into the Word, I have great news for you: God wants to do something special in you. Satan sees what God desires to do and is trying to keep you from that blessing. It’s a big one, a great one. So pick up the Word, let God speak, and discover the blessings in store.",
