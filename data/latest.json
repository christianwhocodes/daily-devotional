  "content": "The Testimony is the Ten Commandments, the two tables of stone written by the finger of God (Exodus 31:18). “Come boldly before the throne of grace and find mercy and grace to help in time of need,” God says to us (see Hebrews 4:16). “But I can’t,” we say. “I haven’t prayed in days. I haven’t been to church in weeks. I haven’t witnessed in months. I haven’t kept the commandments.” Where were the commandments kept? In the Ark. Who kept the commandments? Jesus. “I do always those things that please [the Father],” He said (John 8:29). Jesus kept the commandments perfectly. And as believers, we are in Him positionally (2 Corinthians 5:17). Therefore, the Father looks at us and doesn’t see our sin. He looks at us and sees His Son (Romans 3:22).",
